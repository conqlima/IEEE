\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
In this paper we presented an application to simulate personal health devices in Castalia Simulator. Our application follows the X73-PHD standard with the aid of the Antidote Library. Five agents was implemented and they simulate a real device. The users can feel free to insert more agents. As future work, we intend to develop a manager-initiated transmission where the user can set in manager the amount of measurements to be sent.
