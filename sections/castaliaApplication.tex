\section{Castalia Application Layer}\label{castaliaapplayer}

We have created an application for the Castalia Application Layer. This application is agent-initiated, that is, the agent takes the initiative to send readings to the manager. The agent is the first and the only one to send an \textit{Association request} to start sending measurements, as well as an \textit{Association release}, when there is no more measurements to be sent.

The proposed application has five agent types, pulse oximeter, glucose meter, thermometer, blood pressure, and a basic ECG. The pulse oximeter transmits the pulse rate in beats per second and the Percentage of arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO$_2$). The glucose meter sends the glucose level, that is, the concentration of glucose in the blood in milligrams per deciliter (mg\//dL). The thermometer measures temperature in Celsius (\textdegree C). The blood pressure sends a data compound of systolic, diastolic and the mean arterial pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The basic ECG sends eighty samples of the heart's electric potecial in millivolt (mV) per packet. Each mV sample has to be converted to scaled values before sent. 
%The lower and upper absolute values and the lower and upper scaled values are transmitted in the configuration phase. 
All these agents samples are randomly produced, except the basic ECG that transmits real values obtained from a data base \cite{b2}.

The X73-PHD standard defines confirmed and unconfirmed events. The confirmed events expect a reception acknowledgment from the manager and the unconfirmed events do not. Control messages, like \textit{Association request} and \textit{Association release}, are always sent in confirmed mode, but measurements can be configured to use confirmed or unconfirmed mode. %The implemented parameter to set the desired mode is \textit{SN.node\[node number\].Application.confirmed\_event} which require a Boolean value.

In this application, the user can also set some simulation's parameters like: the medical device type, thermometer, pulse oximeter, blood pressure and etc, the transmission rate in measurements per seconds, the mode of operation confirmed/unconfirmed, the retransmission of the packets rather than trying a new association and the maximum number of retransmission tries. 

\subsection{Unconfirmed measurement event}\label{sec:UnconfirmedMeasurementEvent}

Figure~\ref{fig:unconfirmedMode} shows a sequence diagram of the messaging process corresponding to an ordinary operation of an agent with standard configuration and with unconfirmed measurement events. The agent intends to associate with the manager for the first time, and sends an \textit{Association request}. When the manager receives the \textit{Association request}, it checks if the manager was previously associated. If it is the agent's first association, the manager sends a \textit{Get attributes} message along with the \textit{Association response}. So, the agent sends its configuration and starts to send the measurements to the manager. When there are no more readings to transmit, the agent sends an \textit{Association release} and the manager responds with an \textit{Association release response}.

Figure~\ref{fig:confirmedMode} depicts a sequence diagram of the messaging procedure corresponding to an operation of an agent with standard configuration and with confirmed measurements events. The initial procedure is the same as explained in Section \ref{sec:UnconfirmedMeasurementEvent}, the difference is that the manager sends an acknowledgment for every measurement received. After sending a measurement data, the agent must wait three seconds for an ACK. If an ACK is not received in this period, the agent sends an \textit{Association abort} to the manager, and transits to the unassociated state. If the agent still has readings to send, a new association must be made. % VINICIUS - Reescreve isso aí, pq não deu pra entender - This and others errors conditions is explained in \cite{b1}.

\subsection{Proposed modification in confirmed measurement events}

The X73-PHD standard assumes that there will be a reliable transport layer on real devices. In the Castalia simulator, as in usual wireless sensor networks, a transport layer is not used. So we propose a stop-and-wait system as a sub-application-layer to retransmit agent packets whose ACK have not been received.

%To avoid many associations right after a non-received ACK we implemented a stop-and-wait retransmission system in the application layer. 
It reduces the unnecessary exchange of several control packets made in association procedures. Rather than making a new association when an ACK is lost, we just retransmit the packet $n$ times or until an ACK is received.
%The user can define whether to retransmit and how many retransmission attempts wish.
The user may define a number ($n$) of retransmissions, and the agent will retransmit that message up to $n$ times until a corresponding ACK is received. If the manager receives a duplicated message, it will retransmit immediately another ACK to the agent.

In Section \ref{results}, we evaluate this solution's efficiency in reducing control packets exchange in a WBAN scenario. Note that this is a new proposal, not present in the X73-PHD standard. 
%The parameters implemented for retransmission are \textit{SN.node[nodeNumber].Application.retransmissionPacket} which require a boolean value and \textit{SN.node[nodeNumber].Application.maxNumOfRetransmition} that accepts an integer number.
