Wireless sensor network have been employed and developed to support the research on specific and general-purpose WSN. 
% **colocar na introdução ** Due to the high cost to deploy a real WSN system, simulators is a low-cost option to test the realistic behavior before network before the real implementation.
With the popularization of the 11073 standard several improvements and researches have been made for the smooth operation, interoperability between the devices, and for the simulators of WBAN's.
In \cite{b6} presents an open-source energy-harvesting simulation framework called GreenCastalia which supports multi-source and multi-storage energy harvesting architectures developed for the Castalia simulator. GreenCastalia project main focus is to simulate a realistic battery discharge on devices and not the application that the agents use. 

In \cite{b7},\cite{b8},\cite{b9} and \cite{b10}  propose the integration of ISO/IEEE 11073 and the IOT protocols such as MQTT and COaP as transport protocols to enable the personal health devices directly shares health information through the Internet using low power consumption and few control messages. Also in those works is discussed the availability of enabling IOT technologies for the health information as well as the mapping of the messages from 11073 standard into the IOT protocols. Unlike the first work, these last four papers used real devices with Antidote as application layer protocol.

Another project on 11073 standards is \cite{b11} that has developed an interoperable  end-to-end remote patient monitoring platform using ZigBee Health Care Profile as transport layer and a Machine to Machine (M2M) solution to provide wide area network connectivity. This work also include a web application on the clinical side (server side) and use the protocols like  IHE PCD-01 and HL7 to ensure end-to-end interoperability.
